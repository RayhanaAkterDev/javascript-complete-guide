# üìò 03 - Core JavaScript Mechanics

> **Tags:** javascript, core-concepts, execution-context, closures, prototype  
> **Purpose:** Understand JavaScript‚Äôs internal mechanics and how the language works under the hood.  
> **Overview:** Master scope, closures, the execution context, call stack, prototype chain, and `this` keyword to write better, more predictable code.

## üìù Core Topics Covered

1. **[Execution Context & Call Stack](./01-execution-context-call-stack/README.md):** How JS runs code and manages function calls  
2. **[Memory Management & Garbage Collection](./02-memory-management/README.md):** How JS handles memory allocation and cleanup  
3. **[Scope & Lexical Environment](./03-scope-lexical-environment/README.md):** Variable visibility and environment creation  
4. **[Closures](./04-closures/README.md):** Functions retaining access to outer scope variables  
5. **[`this` Keyword](./05-this-keyword/README.md):** Understanding `this` in different contexts  
6. **[Prototype & Prototype Chain](./06-prototype-chain/README.md):** Inheritance and property lookup mechanism  
7. **[Shadowing & Variable Lookup](./07-shadowing-variable-lookup/README.md):** How variables are resolved when names overlap

### üöÄ How to Approach This Module

1. Read topics sequentially for conceptual build-up.  
2. Experiment with code snippets to visualize execution flow and scopes.  
3. Pay special attention to closures and `this`, as they are foundational yet often confusing.  
4. Use debugging tools to trace call stacks and prototype chains for better understanding.
