# üìò 06 - Advanced Functions

> **Tags:** javascript, functions, higher-order-functions, currying, recursion, debounce, throttle  
> **Purpose:** Explore advanced function patterns and techniques to write scalable, efficient, and reusable JavaScript code.  
> **Overview:** Master higher-order functions, currying, recursion, and performance optimization with debounce and throttle.

### üöÄ How to Approach This Module

1. Follow the topics in order to build understanding from callbacks to advanced patterns.  
2. Experiment by writing your own higher-order functions and recursion examples.  
3. Use debounce and throttle to improve performance in event-heavy scenarios.  
4. Understand function expressions vs declarations for better code clarity.
