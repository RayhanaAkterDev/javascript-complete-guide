# 02 - Core JavaScript Mechanics (Part 1)

This module dives deeper into JavaScript’s **core mechanics** — how code is executed, how scope works, how closures preserve variables, and how `this` behaves.  
Mastering these topics is crucial for writing efficient code, understanding frameworks, and excelling in technical interviews.  
Work through the topics step by step, try examples, and revisit challenging concepts like closures or `this` when needed.
