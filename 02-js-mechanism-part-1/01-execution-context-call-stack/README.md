# 01 - Execution Context & Call Stack

Execution context defines **where and how JavaScript code is executed**.  
The **call stack** manages the order of execution for these contexts.  

Understanding these concepts helps debug scope issues, closures, and function behavior.

## ‚ö° Quick Summary (TL;DR)

- **Execution Context (EC):** Environment where JS code runs  
- **Global EC (GEC):** Created when JS starts; contains global variables and functions  
- **Function EC (FEC):** Created whenever a function is called; has its own scope  
- **Call Stack:** Tracks active execution contexts in **LIFO** order  
- Helps understand **synchronous execution flow**, **variable scope**, and **closures**

## 1. What Is Execution Context?

An **execution context** is like a container that stores:

- Variable environment (`var`, `let`, `const`)  
- Function declarations  
- Reference to the outer environment  
- `this` value  

---

## 2. Types of Execution Context

JavaScript creates a new **execution context** whenever **global code runs or a function is invoked**.  
There are three main types:

### 2.1 Global Execution Context (GEC)

- Created **once** when the program starts  
- Only **one GEC** exists at a time  
- Responsible for:  
  - Global variables & functions  
  - Setting up the **global object** (`window` in browsers, `global` in Node.js)  
  - Defining `this` (points to global object in non-strict mode; `undefined` in strict mode)  

```js
console.log(this); // In browsers ‚Üí Window object
```

---

### 2.2 Function Execution Context (FEC)

- Created **every time a function is invoked**  
- Each function call gets its own context  
- Responsible for:  
  - Local variables, arguments, inner functions  
  - Creating a new **scope chain**  
  - Setting the value of `this` (depends on how function is called)  

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}

greet("Sumaya"); // Creates a new FEC
```

---

### 2.3 Eval Execution Context

- Created when `eval()` runs code inside the current scope  
- Rarely used in modern JS (bad for performance & security)  
- Shares scope with surrounding code  

```js
eval("console.log('Eval context created!')");
```

## 4. Call Stack

The **call stack** is a **stack data structure** that keeps track of active execution contexts.

- **Push:** Add context when a function is called  
- **Pop:** Remove context when function finishes  

**Example:**

```js
function first() {
  console.log("Inside first");
  second();
}

function second() {
  console.log("Inside second");
  third();
}

function third() {
  console.log("Inside third");
}

first();
```

**Call Stack Flow:**

| Step | Call Stack State       |
|------|----------------------|
| 1    | Global EC ‚Üí pushes `first()` |
| 2    | `first()` ‚Üí pushes `second()` |
| 3    | `second()` ‚Üí pushes `third()` |
| 4    | `third()` finishes ‚Üí popped |
| 5    | `second()` finishes ‚Üí popped |
| 6    | `first()` finishes ‚Üí popped |

## üí° Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Keep functions small and focused to reduce stack depth  
- ‚úÖ Avoid deep recursion unless necessary  
- ‚úÖ Understand how the call stack interacts with closures and `this`  
- ‚úÖ Debug using console logs to visualize stack flow
