# üìò 02 - How JavaScript Runs

> **Tags:** javascript, runtime, js-engine, execution-context  
> **Purpose:** Understand how JavaScript code is executed by JS engines in browsers and Node.js.  
> **Overview:** This section explains JavaScript‚Äôs runtime environment, the event loop, call stack, and execution contexts that allow JS code to run.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript Engines

- JS engines like **V8 (Chrome)**, **SpiderMonkey (Firefox)**, and **JavaScriptCore (Safari)** parse, compile, and execute JS code.  
- Engines convert code to machine code or bytecode and optimize it for fast execution.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Execution Context

- When JS runs, it creates an **execution context** for the current scope: global, function, or eval.  
- Context stores variables, functions, and `this` binding relevant to the running code.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Call Stack

- The call stack manages function invocation order.  
- It follows **LIFO** (Last In, First Out) ‚Äî the last function called is the first to return.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Memory Heap

- Memory heap stores objects, variables, and data needed during execution.  
- JS automatically manages memory allocation and garbage collection.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Event Loop and Task Queue

- JS is single-threaded but handles async tasks via the **event loop**.  
- The event loop waits for call stack to clear, then pushes queued tasks to execute.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Single-threaded nature of JS

- JS executes one command at a time but uses event-driven, non-blocking IO for concurrency.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Browser vs Node.js Runtime

- Browsers provide APIs like DOM, timers, and fetch.  
- Node.js offers server-side APIs, file system access, and networking.
