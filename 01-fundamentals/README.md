# 01 - JavaScript Fundamentals

**Tags:** javascript, basics, learning-path, core-concepts  
**Purpose:** Build a solid foundation in JavaScript’s syntax, structure, and runtime behavior.  
**Overview:** Understand how JavaScript executes code, manages data, makes decisions, and controls flow across environments like browsers and Node.js.  
Master these fundamentals before moving on to advanced topics like DOM manipulation, async programming, and real-world applications.

13. [Loops](./13-loops/README.md): Looping constructs and control (`for`, `while`, `do...while`, `for...of`, `for...in`)  
14. [Functions](./14-functions/README.md): Function declaration, expression, arrow functions, parameters, and returns  
15. [Scope](./15-scope/README.md): Global, local, block, and lexical scope explained

## How to Approach This Module

- Follow the topics in sequence for progressive learning.  
- Read each README carefully and test provided code samples.  
- Practice running examples in browser consoles or Node.js environments.  
- Pay close attention to complex topics such as scope, type coercion, and hoisting.  
- Experiment with modifying code to deepen understanding.  
- Revisit challenging concepts as needed to reinforce learning.
