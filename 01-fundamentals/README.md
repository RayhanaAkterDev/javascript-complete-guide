# üìò 01 - JavaScript Fundamentals

> Tags: javascript, basics, learning-path, core-concepts  
> **Purpose:** Build a rock-solid foundation in JavaScript ‚Äî understand its core syntax, structure, and execution flow.

## üß≠ Overview

This module is your starting point for mastering JavaScript.  
You'll explore how JavaScript **works at its core**, how it handles **data**, **logic**, and **control flow**, and how it differs from other languages.

Everything here is essential before moving into advanced projects, DOM manipulation, or asynchronous code.
