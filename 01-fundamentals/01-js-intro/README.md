# 01 - JavaScript Introduction

JavaScript is the language that brings web pages to life.  
It adds logic, interactivity, and behavior to otherwise static HTML and CSS.  
In this first topic, you'll get introduced to what JavaScript is, where it's used, and how to run your first lines of code in the browser.

## 1. What is JavaScript?

- A **high-level**, **interpreted** programming language  
- Used to add **logic**, **interactivity**, and **dynamic behavior** to web pages  
- Runs in the **browser** (frontend) and on the **server** via Node.js (backend)

## 2. JavaScript in the Web Stack

JavaScript is one of the **three core technologies** of the web:

| Technology | Role                        |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| HTML       | Structure and content        |
| CSS        | Styling and layout           |
| JavaScript | Logic and interaction        |

## 3. A Brief History

- Created in **1995** by **Brendan Eich** at Netscape  
- Initially named **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, finally **JavaScript**  
- Standardized as **ECMAScript (ES)**  
- Major modern update: **ES6 (2015)** ‚Äî introduced `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and more

## 4. Key Features of JavaScript

- Interpreted and dynamically typed  
- Object-based and prototype-driven  
- First-class functions (functions as values)  
- Asynchronous capabilities (`setTimeout`, callbacks, promises, `async/await`)  
- Runs in all modern browsers and servers (Node.js)

## 5. Where JavaScript is Used

- **Web development** (frontend + backend)  
- **Mobile apps** (React Native, Ionic)  
- **Desktop apps** (Electron)  
- **Games** (Phaser, Three.js)  
- **IoT** and scripting for devices  
- **Automation**, web scraping, and browser bots

## 6. Common Use Cases

JavaScript enables:

- Real-time form validation  
- Animations and UI transitions  
- Dynamic content updates  
- API integration and data fetching  
- Modal popups, dropdowns, sliders  
- Interactive single-page applications (SPAs)

## 7. Running JavaScript in the Browser

All modern browsers come with a built-in **JavaScript engine**.  
To test code:

1. Open a new browser tab  
2. Right-click ‚Üí **Inspect** ‚Üí Go to **Console** tab  
3. Paste this code:

```js
console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
```

You'll see the output instantly in the console.
