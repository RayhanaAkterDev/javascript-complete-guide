## 1. What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a **high-level**, **interpreted** programming language.  
- Enables developers to add **interactivity**, **logic**, and **dynamic behavior** to web pages.  
- Runs in the **browser** (client-side) and on the **server** (via Node.js).

## 2. JavaScript in the Web Stack

JavaScript is one of the **three core web technologies**:

| Technology | Role                        |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| HTML       | Defines structure and content |
| CSS        | Adds visual style and layout  |
| JavaScript | Controls logic and behavior   |

Together, these create modern, interactive websites and web applications.

## 3. A Brief History of JavaScript

- Created by **Brendan Eich** in 1995 at Netscape.  
- Initially named **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, finally **JavaScript**.  
- Standardized as **ECMAScript (ES)** by ECMA International.  
- Major milestone: **ES6 (2015)** introduced modern syntax like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and classes.

## 4. Key Features of JavaScript

- Interpreted and dynamically typed  
- Object-based and prototype-driven  
- First-class functions (assignable, passable, and returnable)  
- Event-driven and asynchronous (callbacks, promises, async/await)  
- Portable and cross-platform  

---

## 5. Where JavaScript is Used

- **Web development** (frontend and backend with Node.js)  
- **Mobile apps** (e.g., React Native, Ionic)  
- **Desktop apps** (e.g., Electron)  
- **Games** (Phaser, Three.js)  
- **IoT devices**  
- **Automation scripting**

---

## 6. Common Use Cases

JavaScript powers:

- Interactive forms and real-time validation  
- Modal popups, sliders, and dropdowns  
- Animations and transitions  
- API communication (AJAX / fetch)  
- Real-time chat and live updates  
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)

---

## 7. Running JavaScript in the Browser

Modern browsers have built-in **JavaScript engines** (e.g., Chrome‚Äôs V8). To run JavaScript code:

1. Open a browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)  
2. Open Developer Tools ‚Üí **Console** tab  
3. Enter this code:

```js
console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
```

---

## 8. Quick Code Examples

Check the demo in the [`script.js`](./script.js) file.

‚û°Ô∏è Open your `index.html` file in a browser to test it.
Ensure it includes the script with:

```html
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```
