## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a **high-level**, **interpreted** programming language.  
- Enables developers to add **interactivity**, **logic**, and **dynamic behavior** to websites.  
- Runs in the **browser** (client-side) and on the **server** (via Node.js).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ JavaScript in the Web Stack

JavaScript is one of the **three core technologies of the web**:

| Technology | Purpose                     |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| HTML       | Defines structure/content   |
| CSS        | Adds visual style/layout    |
| JavaScript | Controls logic & behavior   |

These technologies work together to create fully functional websites and web apps.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ A Brief History of JavaScript

- Created by **Brendan Eich** in 1995 at Netscape.  
- Initially called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, finally **JavaScript**.  
- Standardized as **ECMAScript (ES)** by ECMA International.  
- Key milestone: **ES6 (2015)** introduced features like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, classes, etc.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features of JavaScript

- Interpreted and dynamically typed  
- Object-based and prototype-driven  
- First-class functions (can be assigned, passed, returned)  
- Event-driven and asynchronous (callbacks, promises, async/await)  
- Portable and cross-platform  

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Where JavaScript is Used

- **Web development** (frontend + backend with Node.js)  
- **Mobile apps** (e.g., React Native, Ionic)  
- **Desktop apps** (e.g., Electron)  
- **Games** (Phaser, Three.js)  
- **IoT** systems  
- **Automation scripting**  

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Common Use Cases

JavaScript is used to build:

- Interactive forms and real-time validation  
- Modal popups, sliders, dropdowns  
- Animations and transitions  
- API communication (AJAX / fetch)  
- Real-time chat and live updates  
- Single Page Applications (SPAs)

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Running JavaScript in the Browser

Every modern browser includes a built-in **JavaScript engine** (e.g., Chrome‚Äôs V8).  
To run simple code:

1. Open a browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)  
2. Open Developer Tools ‚Üí **Console** tab  
3. Type this code:

```js
console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");
```

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Quick Code Examples

Check the demo in the [`script.js`](./script.js) file.

‚û°Ô∏è Open your `index.html` file in the browser to test it.  
Make sure it links the script file like this:

```html
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```
