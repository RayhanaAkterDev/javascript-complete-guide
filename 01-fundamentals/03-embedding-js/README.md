# Embedding JavaScript

**Tags:** `javascript`, `embedding`, `scripts`, `html`, `basics`  
**Purpose:** Understand how to properly embed JavaScript into HTML using different methods.  
**Overview:** This guide covers inline, internal, and external script embedding in HTML. It explains their differences, use cases, and best practices for real-world projects.

## 1. Inline JavaScript

JavaScript code written directly inside HTML element attributes such as `onclick`.

**Example:**

```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click Me</button>
```

This method is simple but not recommended in real-world projects due to security concerns (e.g., XSS attacks) and poor maintainability.

---

## 2. Internal JavaScript

JavaScript code placed inside `<script>` tags within the same HTML file, typically inside `<head>` or `<body>`.

**Example:**

```html
<script>
  console.log("Internal script running");
</script>
```

Use for small, page-specific logic or temporary scripts during development.

---

## 3. External JavaScript

JavaScript stored in a separate .js file and linked using the `<script src="...">` element.  
Promotes separation of concerns, better caching, and reusability.

**Example:**

```html
<script src="scripts/app.js"></script>
```

## 4. Script Tag Attributes

- `defer`: Executes the script after the HTML document has been parsed (only applies to external scripts).  
- `async`: Loads and executes the script asynchronously as soon as it‚Äôs ready (may run out of order).  
- `type="module"`: Treats the script as an ES6 module, allowing use of `import`/`export`.

These attributes help optimize load performance and control execution order.

---

## 5. Best Practices

- Use external scripts to keep code modular and maintainable.  
- Prefer `defer` or `async` to avoid render-blocking.  
- Avoid inline scripts to prevent XSS vulnerabilities and improve security.  
- If not using `defer`, place `<script>` tags just before the closing `</body>` tag.
