# 06 - Comments

Comments are **non-executable notes** in your code that help explain, clarify, and annotate.  
They improve code readability, aid debugging, and support teamwork without affecting how the program runs.

---

## ⚡ Quick Summary (TL;DR)

- Comments do **not run**; they’re for developers only.  
- Use `//` for **single-line comments** and `/* ... */` for **multi-line comments**.  
- Comments help explain *why* code exists, clarify complex logic, or leave notes.  
- Keep comments clear, concise, and updated.

## 1. What Are Comments?

Comments are ignored by JavaScript but essential for human readers.  
They:

- Explain the purpose or reasoning behind code  
- Clarify complicated or tricky parts  
- Leave reminders, TODOs, or debugging notes  

---

## 2. Types of Comments

### 2.1 Single-line Comments

Start with `//` and continue to the line’s end.

```js
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 10; // Inline comment
```

### 2.2 Multi-line Comments

Wrap text between `/*` and `*/` and can span multiple lines.

```js
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  Useful for longer explanations.
*/
let y = 20;
```

## 3. Why Use Comments?

- Document what and why code is doing something  
- Mark code for future fixes or improvements (TODO, FIXME)  
- Temporarily disable code for testing or debugging  
- Add context for complex logic or algorithms  

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- ✅ Write meaningful, relevant comments — avoid stating the obvious  
- ✅ Explain *why* the code does something, not *what* it does  
- ✅ Keep comments updated as code changes  
- ✅ Use consistent formatting and style for readability
