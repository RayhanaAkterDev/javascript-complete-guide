# 06 - Comments

Comments are **non-executable notes** in your code used to explain, clarify, or annotate.  
They improve code readability, help debugging, and assist teamwork without affecting program execution.

## 1. What Are Comments?

Comments are ignored by the JavaScript engine and exist purely for developer reference.

- Explain why certain code exists  
- Clarify complex or non-obvious logic  
- Leave notes for future work or debugging  

---

## 2. Types of Comments

### 2.1 Single-line Comments

Start with `//` and extend to the end of the line.

```js
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 10; // Inline comment
```

### 2.2 Multi-line Comments

Begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. Can span multiple lines.

```js
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span several lines.
*/
let y = 20;
```

## 3. Why Use Comments?

- Document purpose or intent of code sections
- Leave TODOs, FIXMEs, or notes for collaborators
- Temporarily disable code during testing or debugging
- Provide context for complex logic or algorithms

## 💡 Best Practices

✅ Write clear, concise, and relevant comments
✅ Avoid stating the obvious; add value beyond code itself
✅ Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
✅ Use comments to explain why something is done, not what is done
✅ Maintain consistent comment style and formatting
