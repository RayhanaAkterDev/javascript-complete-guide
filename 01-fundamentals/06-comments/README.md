## 1. What Are Comments?

Comments are **non-executable lines** in your code used to explain, clarify, or annotate parts of the program.

- They help developers understand the purpose, logic, or context.
- Comments are **ignored by the JavaScript engine** during execution.

---

## 2. Types of Comments

JavaScript supports two types of comments:

### Single-line Comments

Start with `//` and extend to the end of the line.

```js
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 10; // Inline comment explaining the variable
```

### Multi-line Comments

Start with `/*` and end with `*/`, spanning multiple lines.

```js
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span several lines.
*/
let y = 20;
```

## 3. Why Use Comments?

- Explain complex or non-obvious code logic.  
- Mark TODOs, FIXMEs, or notes for future work.  
- Temporarily disable code during debugging.  
- Provide documentation for functions, classes, or modules.  

---

## 4. Best Practices

- Write clear, concise, and relevant comments.
- Avoid stating the obvious‚Äîcomments should add value beyond the code itself.
- Keep comments up to date with code changes.
- Use comments to explain why something is done, not what is done.
- Use consistent formatting for easier readability.
