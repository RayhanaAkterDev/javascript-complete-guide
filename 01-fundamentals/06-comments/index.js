// --- Multi-line comments: group related context or explain logic clearly ---

/*
  These variables hold additional user information.
  Useful for condition checks and profile setup.

// --- TODO comments: indicate pending tasks or enhancements ---

// TODO: Implement function to validate user input

  Multi-line comments can also be used
  to explain logic inside functions or blocks.

// --- FIXME comments: highlight known issues to fix later ---

// FIXME: Adjust this if age-based rules change

// --- Disabled lines: helpful for temporary debugging ---

// console.log("Debug: age =", age);

// --- Notes: reminders or developer hints ---

// Note: Comments should be clear, relevant, and not overused
