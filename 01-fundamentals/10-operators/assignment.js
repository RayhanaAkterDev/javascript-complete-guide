  Demonstrates JavaScript assignment operators,

  arithmetic in shorthand form.

// --- 1. Basic Assignment ---

let x = 10;              // Assign 10 to x
console.log("x =", x);   // 10

// --- 2. Compound Assignment Operators ---
// Combines arithmetic with assignment

x += 5;                    // ✅ Equivalent to: x = x + 5
console.log("x += 5:", x); // 15

x -= 3;                    // ✅ Equivalent to: x = x - 3
console.log("x -= 3:", x); // 12

x *= 2;                    // ✅ Equivalent to: x = x * 2
console.log("x *= 2:", x); // 24

x /= 4;                    // ✅ Equivalent to: x = x / 4
console.log("x /= 4:", x); // 6

x %= 5;                    // ✅ Equivalent to: x = x % 5
console.log("x %= 5:", x); // 1

// --- 3. Assignment with Strings ---

let str = "Hello";         // Initial string
str += " World";           // ✅ Append " World" to str
console.log('str += " World":', str); // "Hello World"

/*
  🔗 Note:
  Compound assignments are shorthand for
  combining operations and assignments.
