# 04 - Statements & Expressions

**Tags:** `javascript`, `syntax`, `expressions`, `statements`, `language-core`  
**Purpose:** Understand the foundational syntax building blocks of JavaScript‚Äîstatements and expressions‚Äîand how they form the structure of executable code.  
**Overview:** This topic explains the core difference between expressions and statements, where each is used, and why understanding this distinction is essential for writing valid, clean JavaScript logic.

## 1. What Are Expressions?

An **expression** is any valid unit of code that evaluates to a value.

- It does **not** require a semicolon unless it's used as a statement.
- Expressions can be **standalone** or **embedded inside statements**.
- Can be assigned, passed as arguments, or returned from functions.

**Examples:**

```js
5 + 3            // Expression ‚Üí evaluates to 8
"Hi" + " there"  // Expression ‚Üí evaluates to "Hi there"
true             // Expression ‚Üí value is true
x * 2            // Expression ‚Üí evaluates based on variable value
```

## 2. What Are Statements?

A **statement** is a complete instruction that performs an action.

- Typically ends with a semicolon (`;`)
- Can contain one or more expressions
- Controls the flow of execution in the program

**Examples:**

```js
// Declaration statement
let x = 10;

// Assignment statement with expression
x = x + 5;

// Conditional statement
if (x > 10) {
  console.log("x is big");
}

// Loop statement
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

## 3. Key Differences

| Aspect             | Expression                | Statement                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Resolves to        | A value                   | An action or instruction |
| Usage              | Can be part of other code | Forms a full instruction |
| Can end with `;`   | Not always necessary      | Usually ends with `;`    |
| Executes           | As part of a statement    | Executes a full task     |
| Example            | `2 * 3`                   | `let x = 2 * 3;`         |

## 4. Common Examples

- Expression inside a statement:

```js
let total = price * quantity;  // "price * quantity" is the expression
```

- Expression-only return:

```js
return a + b; // "a + b" is the expression
```

- Statement containing expressions:

```js
if (x > 5) {
  console.log("Greater than 5");
}
```

## 5. Best Practices

- Avoid confusing expressions with statements when writing conditional or return logic.  
- Keep expressions small and clear when nested inside statements.  
- Always terminate statements with `;` for consistency and to avoid automatic semicolon insertion pitfalls.  
- Use expressions to keep logic **modular** and **reusable**, such as storing them in functions or variables.
