### üöÄ How to Approach This Module

1. Learn how browser rendering impacts performance via reflows and repaints.  
2. Detect common sources of memory leaks and apply fixes.  
3. Practice writing efficient DOM manipulation code to reduce redraws.  
4. Implement lazy loading and code splitting for faster initial loads.  
5. Use throttling and debouncing to optimize event-heavy interactions.  
6. Optimize loops and event listeners for smoother UI.
